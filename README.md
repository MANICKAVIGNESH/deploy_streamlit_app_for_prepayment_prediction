### Mortgage Trading Analysis and Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting various aspects of mortgage loans, including EMI calculation, total payment, interest amounts, and the risk of pre-payment or delinquency. The project uses machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks to assess the risk of delinquency and predict the likelihood of pre-payment.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various mortgage attributes such as loan amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios (DTI), loan terms, and others.

## Key Features:
OrigInterestRate: Original interest rate of the loan.
OrigLoanTerm: Original term of the loan in months.
OrigUPB: Original unpaid principal balance.
DTI: Debt-to-income ratio.
MonthsInRepayment: Number of months the borrower has been repaying.
EMI: Monthly installment calculated based on the loan terms and interest rate.
current_principal: Remaining principal balance on the loan after a certain number of months.
Delinquent: Indicates whether a borrower is delinquent based on the payment-to-income ratio.
PrePayment_Risk: Indicator of whether the borrower is at high or low risk of pre-payment based on the remaining principal.
Project Workflow
## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the mortgage dataset and calculate important features such as EMI, total payment, interest amount, monthly income, and current principal.
Calculate the monthly payment-to-income ratio and create indicators for delinquency and pre-payment risk.
Replace infinite values with 0 for robustness.
## Feature Engineering:

Calculate custom features like EMI, monthly_income, current_principal, Payment_to_Income_Ratio, and PrePayment_Risk.
Generate a binary delinquency indicator (delinquent_binary) based on the payment-to-income ratio.
## Classification and Regression:

Use a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of a borrower becoming delinquent.
Train a Linear Regression model to predict the likelihood of pre-payment for borrowers classified as delinquent.
## Pipeline:

Implement a custom pipeline combining classification and regression models to streamline the prediction process. The pipeline first classifies borrowers into delinquent or non-delinquent, then applies the regression model to predict pre-payment risk for delinquent borrowers.
Key Code Components

## EMI Calculation:
r = df['OrigInterestRate'] / (12 * 100)
n = df['OrigLoanTerm']
P = df['OrigUPB']
df['EMI'] = P * r * (1 + r) ** n / ((1 + r) ** n - 1)

## Pre-payment Calculation:
def prepay(DTI, monthly_income):
    if DTI < 50:
        p = monthly_income / 2
    else:
        p = monthly_income * 3 / 4
    return p
df['pre_payment'] = np.vectorize(prepay)(df['DTI'], df['monthly_income'] * 24) - (df['EMI'] * 24)

## Classification Model:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_class_train)


## Regression Model:
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train_reg, y_reg_train_filtered)

Custom Pipeline:

class CustomPipeline(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, clf, reg):
        self.clf = clf
        self.reg = reg

    def fit(self, X, y_class, y_reg):
        self.clf.fit(X, y_class)
        X_filtered = X[y_class == 1]
        y_reg_filtered = y_reg[y_class == 1]
        self.reg.fit(X_filtered, y_reg_filtered)
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        y_class_pred = self.clf.predict(X)
        X_filtered = X[y_class_pred == 1]
        y_reg_pred = self.reg.predict(X_filtered)
        return y_class_pred, y_reg_pred
